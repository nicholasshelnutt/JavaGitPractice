# JavaGitPractice

## Assignment Instructions

1. Make a folder for a new repository (name it whatever you want)
2. Run git init to make the folder into a new repository
3. Create a program like described below
4. Add and commit changes as you write the program
5. Create a new repository on your GitHub
6. Connect it to your local repository and push to GitHub
7. Submit a link to your GitHub repository here
8. Make sure your Git repository is public

The program should have the following qualities:

- An abstract class or interface (with at least one abstract method)
- 2 classes that implement or extend the abstract class / interface (and implement the abstract method differently)
- A Demo class with a main method that gets input from the user and validates it.
- Based on user input, assigns a polymorphic variable one of the two classes you created.
- Calls a method of the polymorphic variable
- This should result in different output to the console depending on which class was chosen.
- You have a LOT of freedom. Part of this is practice writing something with little direction. This is practice and largely participation credit, so do not worry about making the best program ever.
